<h1> Round 2 : 100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>

<h2> Day 111; posted: October 1, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as  prebuilt browser objects, higher order functions, arrays,making decisions and objects .

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Computers are really good at repetitive tasks. Learning the core fundamentals of a language is very important on the longrun.

<h2> Day 112; posted: October 2, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as function chaining, js scopes, "This" keyword, arrow functions, template literals and js automatic semicolon insertion.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> what impressed me today about Javascript? its ability to chain multiple actions based on what it returns.function chaining is not limited to arrays; all datatypes can do it.

<h2> Day 113; posted: October 3, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>:i worked on a basic js To-do App in the browser environment. also Worked on some nodejs environment basics; such as the http module and its methods and i got a better understanding of the "req" object in a nodejs server.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> A common disease in programming is the act of trying to learn everything there is, at once and getting confused and giving up. Understand the "why" before using a new fancy library.

<h2> Days 114 & 115: posted: October 5, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: i setup an express server with connection to mongodb. then wrote some anonymous callback functions, Asynchronous promises and CRUD operations using js.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Really learnt alot about the node javascript environment and its jargons. 
First, the express module is a branch of pre-written js code for the node environment that we can leverge (so we dont re-invent the wheel and our code is more organized). 
Secondly, the mongodb is a no sql db.  the db can have many collecctions just like a db can have several tables and each value in the collection is called a document.
Thirdly, one major use of nodejs callbacks, is that upon db connection; it'll run certain functionalities automatically. etc

<h2> Day 116;  posted: October 6, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: i got to learn and use the axios promise feature of js in place of fetch() method for browser and server asychronous communication. integrated full CRUD operation in nodeserver.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> I related the axios and fetch() promise feature, to the way i understood Ajax calls and request to PHP server. tomorrow i'll implement the DRY(do not repeat yourself) productivity skill.

<h2> Days 117 & 118; posted: October  8, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p>i've learnt more about client side rendering,res.send() vs res.json() methods, securing routes using express response Authentication feature,and completed my minimalistic CRUD To-do App.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p>it is important to have lots of small victories along the road towards becoming a better developer; Completing small projects is one of the many ways to cement your skills and keep learning.small wins, small victories ,one of many significant victories.</p>

<h2> Days 119 , 120 & 121;  posted: October 14  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> Over the couple of days i've worked on Understanding routes, middleswares, the boilerplate express.json() & express.urlencode() methods as used in the express framework. As well Organization of my code into components using MVC design pattern. I also worked on useful server side form validations.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> It's been great learning how to implement industry standard techniques and tools in complex application development. Theres always a method the madness.</p>

  <h2> Days 122;  posted: October 15  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I included mongodb connection to my webConnet app. i learnt more about node environmental variables and how to use them with .gitignore file to secure api keys,port and mongodb connection string.i understood the context binding that es6 arrow functions provides as against the tranditonal function that mutates the "this" function and refers to the global object always. </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> Sometimes tech can seem to be overwhelming; its just important to understand the fundamentals first, then use it as a line of reasoning when trying to understand certain concepts. the more i learn js i'm literally constantly in awe to see what it does and how its evolved. i'll work on promises tomorrow to handle response from the modeled data.</p>

   <h2> Days 123;  posted: October 16  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> i worked on handling async operations in javascript using promises, traditional callbacks and asyc await, especially on mongodb methods that return a promise. I also reinforced my knowledge on handling stateless http request using sessions and browser cookies.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> Generally Async operations means more programs can run at the same time. learning and implementing different tools js and node offers, to handle this kind of situations was impressive. And http requests are statless; they dont have knowledge of  previous requests, so sessions and cookies fix their amnesia.</p>

   <h2> Days 124 & 125;  posted: October 18  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I worked on rendering partial pages in ejs such as headers and footers, worked on parsing dynamic data in ejs also storing sessions and flash messages in mongodb db with callbacks before rendering pages. </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> i understand sessions in js better as used in flash messages. The flash is typically used in combination with redirects, ensuring that the message is available to the next page that is to be rendered. </p>

  <h2> Day 126 - 127;  posted: October 20  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I wrote some async functions which returned a promise. i basically used them to handle timing and async actions such as calls to the database and api request. </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> i like the await async feature in js because it helps me write cleaner code by helping with responses which resolve and as to writing ".then(callback) & .catch(callback)".</p>

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I fixed syntax and semantics bugs. removed some repetitive code and worked on the model in my mvc structre of my project . </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> I worked out that my model module should include files or group name of a specific functionality in the app. i'm good!  </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> The passed few days has being made me more enthuisiastic and knowlegdeable in the realm of backend development and development in general. over the weekend i was also involved a hackathon which really boosted my zeal for technology. </p>
