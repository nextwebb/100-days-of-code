<h1> Round 2 : 100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>

<h2> Day 111; posted: October 1, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as  prebuilt browser objects, higher order functions, arrays,making decisions and objects .

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Computers are really good at repetitive tasks. Learning the core fundamentals of a language is very important on the longrun.

<h2> Day 112; posted: October 2, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as function chaining, js scopes, "This" keyword, arrow functions, template literals and js automatic semicolon insertion.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> what impressed me today about Javascript? its ability to chain multiple actions based on what it returns.function chaining is not limited to arrays; all datatypes can do it.

<h2> Day 113; posted: October 3, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>:i worked on a basic js To-do App in the browser environment. also Worked on some nodejs environment basics; such as the http module and its methods and i got a better understanding of the "req" object in a nodejs server.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> A common disease in programming is the act of trying to learn everything there is, at once and getting confused and giving up. Understand the "why" before using a new fancy library.

<h2> Days 114 & 115: posted: October 5, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: i setup an express server with connection to mongodb. then wrote some anonymous callback functions, Asynchronous promises and CRUD operations using js.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Really learnt alot about the node javascript environment and its jargons. 
First, the express module is a branch of pre-written js code for the node environment that we can leverge (so we dont re-invent the wheel and our code is more organized). 
Secondly, the mongodb is a no sql db.  the db can have many collecctions just like a db can have several tables and each value in the collection is called a document.
Thirdly, one major use of nodejs callbacks, is that upon db connection; it'll run certain functionalities automatically. etc

<h2> Day 116;  posted: October 6, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: i got to learn and use the axios promise feature of js in place of fetch() method for browser and server asychronous communication. integrated full CRUD operation in nodeserver.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> I related the axios and fetch() promise feature, to the way i understood Ajax calls and request to PHP server. tomorrow i'll implement the DRY(do not repeat yourself) productivity skill.

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> Over the couple of days i've worked on Understanding routes, middleswares, the boilerplate express.json() & express.urlencode() methods as used in the express framework. As well Organization of my code into components using MVC design pattern. I also worked on useful server side form validations.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> It's been great learning how to implement industry standard techniques and tools in complex application development. Theres always a method the madness.</p>

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I included mongodb connection to my webConnet app. i learnt more about node environmental variables and how to use them with .gitignore file to secure api keys,port and mongodb connection string.i understood the context binding that es6 arrow functions provides as against the tranditonal function that mutates the "this" function and refers to the global object always. </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> Sometimes tech can seem to be overwhelming; its just important to understand the fundamentals first, then use it as a line of reasoning when trying to understand certain concepts. the more i learn js i'm literally constantly in awe to see what it does and how its evolved. i'll work on promises tomorrow to handle response from the modeled data.</p>

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> i worked on handling async operations in javascript using promises, traditional callbacks and asyc await, especially on mongodb methods that return a promise. I also reinforced my knowledge on handling stateless http request using sessions and browser cookies.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> Generally Async operations means more programs can run at the same time. learning and implementing different tools js and node offers, to handle this kind of situations was impressive. And http requests are statless; they dont have knowledge of  previous requests, so sessions and cookies fix their amnesia.</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> i understand sessions in js better as used in flash messages. The flash is typically used in combination with redirects, ensuring that the message is available to the next page that is to be rendered. </p>

  <h2> Day 126 - 127;  posted: October 20  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I wrote some async functions which returned a promise. i basically used them to handle timing and async actions such as calls to the database and api request. </p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> i like the await async feature in js because it helps me write cleaner code by helping with responses which resolve and as to writing ".then(callback) & .catch(callback)".</p>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> The more errors in my code i fix, the more i cement certain concepts in javascript. like the fact that JavaScript functions do not check the number of arguments received. If a function is called with missing arguments (less than declared), the missing values are set to: undefined. this is really knew to me.  </p>

   <h2> Day 166;  posted: December 7  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> I checked out vuejs frontend framework. did i like it? i dont know. maybe if i had more patience; i would have. </p>
<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> All of them frontend frameworks, shouldnt be so opionated. They give you a much steeper learning curve than the language they were built with infact!  </p>

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: <p> being working on a bunch of stuffs
*Code Organisation using MVC design architecture
*code refactoring
*just write code and refactor later
*Always comment your code
*// A 'static method', it's just like a normal function 
// it has no relation with any parent class object instance </p>
<strong>Thoughts:</strong><p> In JavaScript, everything is an object.  
In JavaScript functions are first-class objects, that means you can treat them just like any object, in static methods, you are only adding a property to the function object.</p>

   <h2> Day 173;  posted: December 18  2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: 
    <p> Wrote more routes,ejs templates and event driven DOM mainpulations.I also handled alot of “JavaScript Reference Error Is Not Defined” error logs working with my app's frontend js.  </p>
<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
    <p> 
 To avoid  "JavaScript Reference Error Is Not Defined" error logs, I highly recommend including very clear code comments at the function level to explain what ever optional  parameter is used for, why it’s present, and what aspects of the application necessitate the need for doing something like that.
 The problem might also be resolved in one of two ways.
1. Load the Libraries in Proper Order
2. Leverage Undefined Values i.e check if the variables parsed as arguments to the function is actually defined.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
    <p>Static methods are like auxiliary functions associated with the object which do not use or need the stored properties. </p>
