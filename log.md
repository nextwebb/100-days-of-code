<h2> Day 111: October 1, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as  prebuilt browser objects, higher order functions, arrays,making decisions and objects .

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Computers are really good at repetitive tasks. Learning the core fundamentals of a language is very important on the longrun.

<h2> Day 112: October 2, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Revised some javascript fundamentals such as function chaining, js scopes, "This" keyword, arrow functions, template literals and js automatic semicolon insertion.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> what impressed me today about Javascript? its ability to chain multiple actions based on what it returns.function chaining is not limited to arrays; all datatypes can do it.

<h2> Day 113: October 3, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>:i worked on a basic js To-do App in the browser environment. also Worked on some nodejs environment basics; such as the http module and its methods and i got a better understanding of the "req" object in a nodejs server.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> A common disease in programming is the act of trying to learn everything there is, at once and getting confused and giving up. Understand the "why" before using a new fancy library.

<h2> Day 114 & 115: October 4 & 5, 2019 </h2

<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: i setup an express server with connection to mongodb.then wrote some callback anonymous functions,Asynchronous promises and CRUD operations using js.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Really learnt alot about the node javascript environment and its jargons. 
First, the express module is a branch of pre-written js code for the node environment that we can leverge (so we dont re-invent the wheel and our code is more organized). 
Secondly, the mongodb is a no sql db.  the db can have many collecctions just like a db can have several tables and each value in the collection is called a document.
Thirdly, one major use of nodejs callbacks, is that upon db connection; it'll run certain functionalities automatically. etc
